# Lumina Showroom Website

This project contains the marketing website for Lumina, a floating trading assistant for TradingView.

## Project Goal
Drive trust and installs for the Lumina extension by providing visual proof, highlighting security features, and offering a seamless installation path.

## Structure
- `index.html`: The main single-page landing site. 
- Uses Tailwind CSS and Lucide icons via CDN (zero-dependency local environment).

## Deployment
This is a static site. Simply host the `index.html` on any static hosting provider (GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify).
